# About the dataset
In this repository, there is a folder/file called "data".This is a web scrap dataset of almost 100000 rows, has multiple columns of which the target or the predictor variable is present in the column : “project_type”. 
Feel free to train with any number of features and try predicting the column “project_type”.  Do bring your codes to the session or can add it to a new git repo and share it to us.

Again, there are no right or wrong answers. Good Luck !
